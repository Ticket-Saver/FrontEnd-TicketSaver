          At Ticket Saver, we take the security of your payment information very seriously. We are

            • Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption: We use SSL encryption to protect the
            transmission of data between your browser and our servers, ensuring that your
            information remains confidential.
          </p>
          <p className='text-lg mb-4'>
            • Tokenization: We tokenize payment information to replace sensitive data with unique
            identification symbols, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to cardholder data.
          </p>
          <p className='text-lg mb-4'>
            • Access control: We restrict access to cardholder data to authorized personnel only and
            implement strong authentication measures to prevent unauthorized access.
